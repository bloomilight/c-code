Final Essay Outline
Argument: Conflicts have been constantly existing between society and individuals.  thinkers through out the history have been trying to solve the conflicts between society and individuals through out the history,as well as keep the balance between society and individuals. Although new problems will always rise. Solving these conflict itself is a way of progress of the relation between society and individuals. This is a problem that changes with the time and can never be solved, but what is important is the effort on solving the problem and it did make the world better.

Units: 
On government: 
Hobbes: Leviathan  Rousseau: The social contract
On liberty and surveillance: 
Zuboff: The age of surveillance capitalism  Teachout: The boss will see you now

Reasons:
I choose these two units which contain four articles as representatives of the possible solutions to the different conflicts between the society and citizens from now and then.They showed human’s continuous effort to improve the relationship between society and citizens.

Hobbes and Rousseau:
Leviathan and The social contract stands for the two main opinions at that time after the enlightenment. Which to me is the representative of those brief thoughts on the relation between society and citizens at that special(particular) time. For Hobbes’s idea, his thoughts on the nature status (quotation about nature status) and his solutions to help save human (quotations about giving away their natural rights) and avoid war, is quite simple. 
But this opinion was too absolute and cruel from nowadays view. Nevertheless, his argument on power and the relation between the government and the citizens is meaningful and has influenced many famous thinkers like Foucault. Also, Rousseau’s social contract was also a classic piece that influenced a lot of people. His opinions on social contract (quotations on social contract) including the rights that a society and citizens should have was more smooth and acceptable compared to Hobbes’ idea. For Rousseau’s idea, history proved that his theory was more suitable for the nation at that time. The later development most followed Rousseau’s idea of social contract as a further development and change of their country. Rousseau’s idea influenced the following decades a lot and can be recognized as the pioneer of the french revolution.


Zuboff and Teachout:
Two recent articles from Zuboff and Teachout revealed the new conflicts between society and citizens, which is ‘surveillance’ . After centuries of development. The political relation between citizens and society has got more and more stable. Different nations have all found their way of development and has been consistently developing. But as the technology is developing fast, surveillance of the citizens has become the new problem between the society and the individuals. In Zuboff’s article she discussed the arouse of surveillance capitalism and also the problems of it (quotations of surveillance capitalism and we should fight against it). 
Teachout later expanded from Zuboff’s idea and detailed into the relation of the boss and the workers(which can also be seen as a kind of society). these two articles discussed about the problems of society of nowadays in comparison to other two articles that i mentioned above. This could be thee proof of there are developing conflicts between society and the citizens. And the process of development is to eliminate these conflicts.

Relations:
The first two article of Hobbes and Rousseau are comparisons of the opinions at that time in ancient Europe. They stands for two main sides ideas to point out the problems of feudalism at that time. And pushed the change in the Europe society. They are also the pave stone of human’s study of the relation of society and citizens.
The last two articles is the discussion of new conflict between society and citizens around the topic of ‘privacy’. in this pair Teachout can be seen as an extend of Zuboff’s idea
of surveillance.
I put these articles together because they all discussed the conflicts between society and individuals. And it shows that conflict is a constant problem that exists and will maintain forever. But it is not frustrating at all. As solving these conflict itself is a way of progress of the relation between society and individuals. The aim is to improve, and keep pace with the times.
